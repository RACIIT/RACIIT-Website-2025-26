    description: `Creative software; a blanket term used for tools that allow users to create and edit digital content. These applications help in improving one’s skills and expressing ideas. Thus, it can be used in both personal and professional purposes as fields such as graphic design, video editing and animation depend on creative software. However, creative software can also be intimidating for some users, especially beginners or those who are not familiar with the interface or terminology of the software. While other users may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the software as it takes a lot of time and effort to master. Therefore, to facilitate those with interest but find it difficult to find a point of entry, Creatik; a series of webinars was created.

Creatik 2023, the event’s fourth consecutive year focused on teaching creative software such as Adobe Photoshop and Da Vinci Resolve, each taught by different professionals in the industry. The opening webinar hosted by Speaker Shaqeek Khan held on the 18th of January taught its participants how to use Photoshop, the most popular graphic designing software. The use of Figma, a tool used to design web pages was taught on the 3rd of February by Speaker Naween Wanigasinghe. The 12th of February; the final day had two webinars. The first of which focused on Lightroom, a photo editing software taught by Speaker Vithurshan Sharma and the latter hosted by Speaker Tharoushan Kandarajah in which Da Vinci Resolve, a popular video editing software was taught.

The event was a great success with over 200 participants. The speakers shared their knowledge and insights to the participants. The feedback from the participants was overwhelmingly positive and many have expressed interest in honing their creative skills through software. We hope to see its participants become professionals and to this event to continue its streak of positivity.
