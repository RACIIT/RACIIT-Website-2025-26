  { title: "Project Lifeline", description: `Suicide is a significant public health concern in Sri Lanka. It’s no secret that Sri Lanka has a
tolerant culture and encourages certain suicides, like altruistic suicide. It is common to observe
a permissive attitude toward suicide because suicides frequently cause concern for the
deceased.

Some media reports that give suicide a heroic status frequently promote suicide culture. The
inability of vulnerable individuals to cope and the failure of friends and family to acknowledge
their suffering are thought to be the main contributors to the recent increase in suicide rates.
Because lethal substances are readily available for self-poisoning during difficult times, easy
access to lethal pesticides and medications contributes to a high suicide rate.

The unofficial Rotaract motto, "Fellowship Through Service," refers to meeting new people and
improving the community at the same time. The IIT Rotaract Club places a high value on giving
back to the community. To assist people with their mental health, our club’s Community Service
avenue launched the Project Lifeline initiative. Numerous people require assistance with their
mental health but lack access to the necessary resources. Therefore Rotaract in IIT launched
Project Lifeline in order to address this issue.

Four phases of Project Lifeline were first introduced. Studies show that there have been a
significant increase in suicides worldwide. People’s decisions to commit suicide were frequently
influenced by their mental health. Together with the National Institute of Mental Health, we
made the decision to address this problem. Nearly 80 people participated in an online session
led by doctors Nadeera Attanayake and Wajantha Kotalawala from the National Institute of
Mental Health to discuss the value of mental health, its causes, and the various things that can
be done. By holding career development and mental health sessions at Ragama’s Diyagala Boys Town on
March 17, we were able to wrap up the second phase. Dr. Maliduwa Liyanage Harshini and D.V.
Gayajith Sanjeewa Fonseka were our special guests for this event, which attracted more than
fifty students. They both delivered an excellent presentation on dealing with mental illness and
how studying can improve one’s chances for the future.
The session was finished with a friendly football game between the boys from the orphanage
and club members.

In the third stage of the project, we were able to deliver a fully functional computer lab to the
Thalahena rehabilitation center in collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors and Standard
Chartered. Additionally, we were able to hold a session where the rehab patients could learn some fundamental IT skills. This had as its main goal giving rehabilitation facilities support for
education and computer literacy.`, image: PD2 },
  { title: "Book Barn : Fundraising Second-Hand Book Sale", description:`Book Barn was a fundraising second-hand book sale organized by the Rotaract Club of Informatics Institute of Technology. A book sale was initiated to give books to fellow students and the general public at a very cheap and affordable price. Book Barn took place at Good Market, Racecourse on the 30th of July, 2022 from 9.00 am.

More than 600 books were collected, which included textbooks, past paper books, and workbooks from the Local syllabus, textbooks from the Cambridge/Edexcel syllabus, storybooks, and magazines. For all books collected, the selling price was at least 50 percent less than the original price of the respective book. All funds raised by Book Barn went towards the club’s signature community service project, E-Mithudama, under which the club builds and donates computer laboratories to children in rural areas with limited learning resources.

All the books for the sale were selected in a two-step process. The first step was to check the condition of the book look-wise to see if it was in a state where another person could use the same book. The second step was to find out if anything was written in any of the books to an extent where another person could not use the books.

Once the books passed these two procedures, they were priced depending on how they passed the above-mentioned checks.

Not only did Book Barn give the general public an opportunity to get their preferred books for cheaper rates, it also helped foster friendship and bond within the directors. Book Barn successfully concluded on the same day at 5.00 pm, after a day filled with fun, hard work, stress, and many more emotions.`, image: PD3 },
  { title: "Point Of Order", description: `A project centered on public speaking and debate abilities was called "Point of Order," organized by the IIT Rotaract Club. This project was an annual board of directors debating session, but we were able to expand the project's scope this time. The project included three phases.

The director’s debate was the first part, followed by a webinar on public speaking and debating skills led by Mr. Ashwin Laksumanage, and finally, the debate competition, which was only open to RACIITians and IITians.

The exco served as judges for the day's discussion in the first phase, which was a pleasant event with the board of directors and the exco. The two teams, "Pdf files" and "Say no to pedos," were made up of the directors. The discussion on "Is age difference between two spouses significant in an adult relationship?" was ultimately won by team "Pdf files."

Mr. Ashwin Laksumanage focused on the fundamentals of debate and public speaking during the second phase's free webinar. All attendees of the online Google Meet session enjoyed hearing their fellow batchmates and friends discuss the subjects presented by our guest speaker during this very interactive event.

The debate competition, which was the initiative's most fascinating phase, was the final stage. Four teams battled to be the day's champions, with judges Mr. Santhuka Rupathunga and Mr. Hirusha Perera serving as professional debaters and members of the Model United Nations. After the first round, the judges chose two teams to compete on the question, "Are introverts or extroverts more likely to succeed in life?" The last round's topic was "Are schools with only one gender better for students?" which sparked a lively discussion. After a Q&A session with the audience, the judges provided personalized commentary for each debater, bringing an end to Point of Order 2022.`, image: PD4 },
  { title: "Forage 22- Scavenger Hunt", description:`Forage 2022 was a scavenger hunt event hosted by the Rotaract Club of IIT (RACIIT). It was held in two phases. The first phase was successfully concluded on the 22nd of August 2022 and was an exclusive event for the directors of RACIIT.

Phase II was held on the 18th of September 2022. This phase was open to all students of IIT, who were able to create teams and participate. Over 15 teams took part in the competition. Each team consisted of 5 players and an appointed leader. The hunt kicked off at Viharamadevi Park at 11 am. Each team was given a piece of paper with a vague clue describing the details about the next destination they would have to travel to and search for their next clue. 

Along the way, each team was given a set of challenges that needed to be completed in order to receive the next clue. Each challenge was recorded by one of the team members, and the video was posted in a WhatsApp group as proof of completion. Challenges included giving strangers high fives, eating a dish from a foreign country, performing 30 push-ups in public, howling like a wolf on the street, singing songs, and meditating in public. 

The rules for the scavenger hunt required all teams to use public transport to travel from place to place and to complete all challenges at a location before moving forward. The clues during the event took teams to various colorful locations in Colombo, including Independence Square, The Central Perk Café, and Galle Face Green. At each location, players were given unique games to finish as fast as possible to receive the next clue. These games included crosswords on historical facts, word games, guessing games, and charades.

After almost six hours of scavenging, the top two teams who made it to the final location had to battle to be crowned champions. Both teams were given a final set of challenges at Galle Face Green. As before, the teams recorded themselves completing the challenges and showed proof to the directors of RACIIT. After the final challenges, Team "The Simps" emerged victorious. The winning team included leader Imaam and members Nisal, Udula, Niketh, and Hanif. 

The event concluded around 5 pm with a group photo, and the winners received their prize. Participants of Forage 2022 unanimously agreed they had a great time and eagerly await another event like this.`, image: PD5 },
  { title: "Emp-LawYee", description: `Employment law is an essential aspect of any working society. It governs the relationship between employers and employees, outlining what each party can expect from the other. In Sri Lanka, both the private and state sectors engage, and there are robust laws in place to protect workers and employers. Emp-LawYee, an initiative by the Rotaract Club of IIT, aims to educate current employees on their rights and the laws that govern their actions to reduce employee dissatisfaction.

One of the critical objectives of Emp-LawYee is to help employees identify the seven most common types of workplace harassment and how to react to them. Sadly, employees are often not aware of the laws that protect them from harm in the workplace, leading to dissatisfaction. This lack of knowledge is a critical factor that contributes to employees’ frustration with their jobs. Emp-LawYee’s goal is to provide employees with a clear understanding of the laws that govern them and how to utilize them.

The initiative took place in two phases, with the first being a two-week PR campaign. This campaign consisted of educational content on the fourteen basic labor laws summarized to fit the understanding of the general public. The second phase was a hybrid event conducted by lawyers who educated a large number of employees through both webinars and physical sessions. Additionally, an eBook containing the labor laws and regulations was released, written by an experienced lawyer. The handbook covers a vast list of labor laws and provides a short description of what they are.

Emp-LawYee emphasized the necessity and importance of labor laws, which impact different aspects of an organization or firm, such as employee-employer relations, minimizing industrial disputes, protecting workers from exploitation, ensuring fair wages, minimizing labor unrest, reducing conflicts and strikes, ensuring job security for workers, promoting favorable environmental conditions in the industrial system, fixing rest pauses and work hours, and providing compensation to workers who were victims of accidents.

The project spread awareness under nine broad headings: employment, individual employment relationships, wages and remuneration, conditions of work, health, safety, and welfare, social security, trade unions and industrial relations, and the administration of labor law. Each of these areas plays a critical role in protecting employees and employers and ensuring a healthy and fair work environment.

Employment laws are designed to protect both workers and employers in their dealings with each other and their employment contracts. They provide guidelines for what employers can ask of employees and what employees can expect from employers. The laws also ensure that workers are not exploited and have a safe and fair work environment. Understanding these laws is essential for employees to protect their rights and for employers to ensure compliance with regulations.

The project’s PR campaign and events aimed to educate a vast number of employees on these laws and regulations. By doing so, Emp-LawYee helped to reduce employee dissatisfaction and promote a fair and safe work environment. Employees who understand their rights and the laws that protect them are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs and work effectively.

Overall, Emp-LawYee was a successful initiative that helped to educate a vast number of employees on their rights and the laws that protect them. By spreading awareness of labor laws and regulations, the project aimed to reduce employee dissatisfaction and promote a fair and safe work environment. The campaign and events held by Emp-LawYee demonstrated the importance of labor laws and how they impact both employees and employers. The project’s success emphasizes the necessity of continuing initiatives like Emp-LawYee to ensure that employees and employers are aware of their rights and the laws that govern them.`, image: PD6 },
